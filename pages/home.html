HireMee is a talent acquisition and talent management platform that provides a range of talent services, from recruitment to staff management and even skill enhancement. HireMee’s offerings cater to individuals, students, institutions, jobseekers, recruiters as well as corporates.

The company started as a social enterprise to help students from tier II & tier III cities get hired via assessment tests and skill scores and by connecting them with suitable recruiters, thereby democratising the freshers’ recruitment process, with the services provided at no cost to both students and recruiters. HireMee has today emerged as an awarded company with a mission of preparing the workforce for the future and enhancing youth employability. HireMee has also been identified as one of the leading rapid re-skilling platforms, by the XPRIZE Foundation, USA.

HireMee’s platform has the capability of AI-based proctoring for all kinds of assessments – be it institution examinations, or company-based assessment tests. HireMee has also launched a Learning Experience Platform this year.

HireMee helps recruiters with everything – from providing pre-assessed and interview-ready candidates, faster screening and better matches through quick video profiles, to customised tests and even talent management. HireMee is recognised for its Psychometric Assessments with these custom assessments covering verbal and quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning, behavioural aptitude, programming/coding, communication, as well as domain knowledge. HireMee’s products have the capability to filter questions to prepare assessments as suited for any and all kinds of job profiles, covering a wide range of domains.

Students and institutions benefit from our deep industry insights when they avail our services of skill assessment tests and scientific evaluations – that give detailed diagnostics and career readiness reports. HireMee, through its employability enhancement program, also helps job aspirants bridge their skill gaps as per current industry needs. HireMee conducts a sweep mode employability test – the HireMee Employability and Eligibility Test, or HEET, twice every year, across all institutions pan-India, and this is endorsed by many corporates both from IT and core sectors.

HireMee has partnered with the National Career Service Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India, AICTE (NEAT 2.0), and several other government and state departments of education.
